#Why use an online tool?

As developer I find myself constantly examining (text) files.
  
  Now, although pretty much every IDE (and various stand-alone products)
  I got very tired of having to create files / install tools
  just in order to perform a simple e fast operation.
  
  This is why I made this online tools/webapp
